# add-pr-link-wip

WIP Github action that, upon opening a new PR, puts a comment with a link, according to a configured pattern, into said PR (with the PR number swapped in). 

In theory, this could have some utility in pointing to per-PR review environments, though in reality, this is more just some old playing around with GH actions.
